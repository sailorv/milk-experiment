                <p>Rydell got his bag of cornflakes out of the cupboard and carefully unrolled it. About enough for a bowl. He opened the fridge and took out a plastic, snap-top, liter container with a strip of masking-tape across the side. He'd written <strong>MILK EXPERIMENT</strong> on the masking-tape with a heavy marker.</p>
                <p>"What's that?" Hernandez asked.<br />
                "Milk."<br />
                "So why's it say 'experiment'?"<br />
                "So nobody'll drink it."</p>

In fact, I was downright sad to finish this trilogy - I would follow Binti's story through all of spacetime. Ursula K. Le Guin says it best: "There's more vivid imagination in a page of Nnedi Okorafor's work than in whole volumes of ordinary fantasy epics."`} />
